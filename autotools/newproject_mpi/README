This document provides the steps to build new MPI program for VE architecture.

a) Self-Build and Defult Architecture:

1.	Move to the project directory
$ cd <project_directory_path>

2.	To set up the MPI compilation environment, execute the following script (This step execution is only applicable for MPI programs)
$ source /opt/nec/ve/mpi/<version>/bin/necmpivars.sh 
Where{version} is the directory name corresponding to the version of NEC MPI you use.

3.	Execute autoreconf
$ /opt/nec/ve/bin/autoreconf –isf

4.	Execute configure to generate Makefile
$ ./configure CC=mpicc CXX=mpic++ FC=mpifort AR=/opt/nec/ve/bin/nar

b)Cross Build and Setting Architecture for VE

1.	Move to the project directory
$ cd <project_directory_path>

2.	To set up the MPI compilation environment, execute the following script (This step execution is only applicable for MPI programs)
$ source /opt/nec/ve/mpi/<version>/bin/necmpivars.sh 
Where{version} is the directory name corresponding to the version of NEC MPI you use.

3.	Execute autoreconf
$ /opt/nec/ve/bin/autoreconf –isf

4.	Execute configure to generate Makefile
$ ./configure --host=ve-nec-linux
